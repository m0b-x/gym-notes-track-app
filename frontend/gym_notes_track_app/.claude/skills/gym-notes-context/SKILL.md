# Gym Notes Context

Gym Notes is an **offline-first Flutter app for tracking gym progress** through folders, markdown notes, counters, and a calendar. It is a training log first, a generic notes app second. Optimize for fast, reliable use mid-workout: no lost text, no layout shifts, minimal taps.

## 1. Read the canonical context first

Read [COPILOT_CONTEXT.md](../../../COPILOT_CONTEXT.md) before planning or editing. It is the source of truth for product purpose, stack, architecture, feature areas, persistence rules, UX direction, and error handling. Do not restate it to the user; follow it.

## 2. Architecture flow (never bypass layers)

```
Page/Widget -> BLoC -> Service -> Repository -> DAO -> Drift database
```

- BLoCs (`lib/bloc/`) stay thin: route events, manage loading/error state, delegate to services. States/events are sealed + `Equatable` where that is the local pattern.
- Services (`lib/services/`) own workflows (note storage, counters, settings, backup, auto-save, import/export, calendar events...).
- Repositories (`lib/repositories/`) provide cached/reactive access over DAOs — invalidate caches after create/update/delete/move/reorder.
- DAOs (`lib/database/daos/`) own SQL/Drift, transactions, soft deletes, FTS, migrations.
- Constants live in `lib/constants/` — use existing spacing/text/icon/settings-key/JSON-key constants, never magic values.
- DI is `get_it` via `lib/core/di/injection.dart`.

## 3. Non-negotiable rules

- Every user-visible string goes through `AppLocalizations` — update `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`, `app_de.arb`, `app_ro.arb` together, then run `flutter gen-l10n` (see the `l10n` skill).
- Never hand-edit generated files (`lib/database/database.g.dart`, generated localization Dart files).
- Drift schema changes require a migration + `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` (see the `drift-migrations` skill). Never reset user storage.
- **No code comments, no new tests, no new markdown docs unless explicitly requested.**
- Preserve data semantics: soft deletes, CRDT fields (`hlcTimestamp`, `deviceId`, `version`, `isDeleted`), positions, sort preferences, pinned counters, backup format compatibility.
- Settings go through `SettingsService` + `SettingsKeys` — never raw `SharedPreferences` keys.
- UI: Material 3, compact, touch-friendly, stable layouts (no layout shift in editor/toolbar/counters/lists), light/dark/system themes.
- No new state-management, persistence, or navigation patterns without a strong reason.

## 4. Feature-area pointers

- Folder/note browser: `lib/pages/optimized_folder_content_page.dart`.
- Note editor: `lib/pages/optimized_note_editor_page.dart` (re_editor, toolbar, preview, auto-save — see the `markdown-engine` skill).
- Counters: `lib/services/counter_service.dart`, `counter_management_page.dart`, `counter_per_note_page.dart`. Global counter values use `noteId == ''` in `counter_values`. Shortcut counter bindings: `CustomMarkdownShortcut.counters` (max 2) with `{c1}`/`{c2}` tokens expanded by `ShortcutApplier`.
- Auto-save: `lib/services/auto_save_service.dart` — be careful with debounce, interval saves, lifecycle flushes, retries.
- Backup: `lib/services/backup_service.dart` — versioned JSON; keep old backups importable when adding persisted fields.
- Import/export: UI only through `ImportExportBloc`; `createX` stamps timestamps to now, `importX` preserves caller timestamps; archive schema bumps require bumping `ImportExportService.archiveVersion` and accepting the previous version in `_assertSupportedManifest`; exports go through `shareExport` (temp-file cleanup) — never call `SharePlus` directly from pages/blocs.
- Multi-database: `lib/services/database_manager.dart`. Any DB-backed singleton must follow the `DatabaseLifecycle` reset contract (see the `drift-migrations` skill).
- Last-location restore: `AppNavigator.restoreLastLocation()` from `main.dart`; keep existence checks — never navigate to a deleted folder/note.
- Local editor fork: `packages/re_editor/` — preserve its perf optimizations (2-slot `asString` cache, bounded LRU paragraph cache, binary-search lookups, 50 ms highlight debounce, `cloneShallowDirty()` contract).

## 5. Validation (PowerShell on Windows)

Run only what the change requires:

| Change type | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| UI-only Dart change | `dart analyze lib` |
| ARB / l10n change | `flutter gen-l10n`, then `dart analyze lib` |
| Drift table / DAO / migration | `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`, then `dart analyze lib` |
| Manual run | `flutter run` |

Helper scripts: `.\build_release.bat arm64`, `.\install_to_device.bat arm64`, `.\generate_drift.bat`.

## 6. When to ask vs act

Act without asking when the request is concrete and matches existing patterns. Ask only when a change would break persisted-data backward compatibility, change backup format semantics, or introduce a new architectural pattern.
