# Gym Notes - Copilot Context

## Product Purpose
Gym Notes is an offline-first Flutter app for tracking gym progress through structured notes, folders, markdown, and counters. Treat it as a training log first and a generic notes app second.

When changing the app, optimize for fast workout-session use:
- Users should be able to capture sets, reps, weights, PRs, bodyweight, soreness, exercises, routines, and session notes with minimal friction.
- Editing must feel reliable during or after a workout: no lost text, no surprising navigation, no heavy UI while typing.
- Organization should support real gym habits: folders for programs or muscle groups, notes for sessions/templates, counters for global or per-note metrics.
- Offline data ownership matters. Preserve local SQLite data, backup/restore behavior, and future sync readiness.
- UI should be practical, touch-friendly, and quick to scan in a gym environment. Prefer clear controls, high contrast, stable layouts, and small but obvious status feedback.

## Core User Workflows
- Create folders/subfolders for programs, routines, exercises, weeks, or muscle groups.
- Create and edit markdown notes for workouts, templates, exercise logs, measurements, and progress history.
- Use custom markdown toolbar shortcuts for fast entry of headings, lists, checkboxes, tables, dates, and repeated workout structures.
- Track numeric progress with counters, including global counters and per-note counters with pinning and manual ordering.
- Search across notes and within the active note, including regex/whole-word options in the editor search overlay.
- Switch databases, export/import backups, and keep localized app text in English, German, and Romanian.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- Use `AppLocalizations` for every user-visible string. Update `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`, `app_de.arb`, and `app_ro.arb` together, then run `flutter gen-l10n`.
- Do not hand-edit generated files such as `lib/database/database.g.dart` or generated localization Dart files.
- After changing Drift tables, DAOs, migrations, or database annotations, run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
- Keep generated schema/migration changes compatible with existing local user data. Add migrations instead of resetting storage.
- Do not add tests, new markdown files, broad refactors, or code comments unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve existing user data semantics: soft deletes, CRDT fields, positions, sort preferences, pinned counters, note assignments, and backup format compatibility.
- Keep changes focused and consistent with the local style. Avoid introducing new state-management, persistence, or navigation patterns without a strong reason.

## Current Stack
- Flutter app with Dart SDK `^3.10.4`, Material 3, and `flutter_lints`.
- State management: `flutter_bloc` with `Equatable` states/events.
- Persistence: Drift SQLite, `sqlite3_flutter_libs`, `path_provider`, `shared_preferences`.
- DI: `get_it` via `lib/core/di/injection.dart`.
- Editor/markdown: local `packages/re_editor` with a custom line-based markdown renderer (`lib/utils/line_based_markdown_builder.dart`).
- Search/debounce: `stream_transform`, FTS5, isolate-backed indexing utilities.
- Sharing/import: `share_plus`, `file_picker`.
- External links: `url_launcher` (markdown preview hyperlinks open via `LaunchMode.externalApplication`; only `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel` schemes are accepted).
- Localization: Flutter gen-l10n with locales `en`, `de`, `ro`.

## Architecture Shape
Follow the existing flow:

```text
Page/Widget -> BLoC -> Service -> Repository -> DAO -> Drift database
```

- BLoCs live under `lib/bloc/` and should stay thin: route events, manage loading/error states, and delegate business logic to services.
- Services in `lib/services/` own app workflows such as note storage, folder storage, search indexing, counters, settings, backup/restore, database switching, auto-save, and note positions.
- Repositories in `lib/repositories/` provide cached/reactive access over DAOs. Invalidate caches carefully after creates, updates, deletes, moves, and reorder operations.
- DAOs in `lib/database/daos/` own SQL/Drift details, transactions, soft deletes, pagination, FTS, and migrations support.
- Models in `lib/models/` generally use `Equatable`, `copyWith`, and JSON keys from `lib/constants/json_keys.dart`.
- Constants belong in `lib/constants/`. Prefer existing spacing, text style, icon size, settings key, and app constant files over magic values.

## Main Feature Areas
- `lib/pages/optimized_folder_content_page.dart`: main folder/note browser with nested folders, pagination, sorting, reordering, swipe actions, FAB creation, and navigation.
- `lib/pages/optimized_note_editor_page.dart`: main workout note editor with `re_editor`, markdown toolbar, preview/split modes, auto-save, note position persistence, search/replace, sharing, and debug overlays.
- `lib/widgets/markdown_toolbar.dart`: configurable shortcut and utility toolbar. Use `UtilityButtonDefinition` as the registry for utility buttons.
- `lib/pages/markdown_settings_page.dart`, `shortcut_editor_page.dart`, `note_bar_assignment_page.dart`: markdown shortcut profiles and per-note toolbar assignment.
- `lib/pages/counter_management_page.dart` and `counter_per_note_page.dart`: global/per-note counter workflows for workout metrics.
- `lib/services/counter_service.dart`: counter cache, debounced writes, pinning, ordering, import/export, and flush behavior.
- `lib/services/auto_save_service.dart`: note content save reliability. Be careful with debounce, interval saves, lifecycle flushes, and retry behavior.
- `lib/services/backup_service.dart`: JSON backup/restore. Keep versioned compatibility when adding persisted fields.
- `lib/services/import_export_service.dart`: per-note and per-folder share/import (single files or `.zip` archives). Owns archive `manifest.json` versioning, temp-file cleanup, and unique-name resolution. The matching `ImportExportBloc` (`lib/bloc/import_export/`) is the only allowed entry point for the UI.
- `lib/services/database_manager.dart`: multi-database management and active database selection.

## Markdown Preview Pipeline
The note-editor preview is fully BLoC-driven. Keep this layering intact:

```text
OptimizedNoteEditorPage
  -> MarkdownPreviewBloc (lib/bloc/markdown_preview/)
     -> MarkdownRenderService (lib/services/markdown_render_service.dart)
        -> LineBasedMarkdownBuilder (lib/utils/line_based_markdown_builder.dart)
           -> MarkdownChunker (lib/utils/markdown_chunker.dart)      // block scan + chunk layout
           -> MarkdownListSyntax (lib/utils/markdown_list_syntax.dart) // shared list grammar
  -> MarkdownPreviewBlocView (lib/widgets/markdown_preview_bloc_view.dart)
     -> SourceMappedMarkdownView (lib/widgets/source_mapped_markdown_view.dart)
```

Non-negotiable invariants:

- Bloc state is `Equatable` and contains only primitives + a `renderHandle: int` token. Never put `InlineSpan` trees, builders, or other heavy objects in state.
- Spans are pulled from `bloc.renderService.builder` on demand; the widget rebuilds the heavy list only when `renderHandle`, `linesPerChunk`, or `fontSize` change (`buildWhen`).
- The bloc owns its `MarkdownRenderService` and `PreviewScrollController` and disposes them in `close()`. The page wires callbacks via `bloc.bindCallbacks(onLinkTap:, onCheckboxTap:)`.
- **Content sync**: use `bloc.bindContentProvider(() => _contentController.text)` once in `initState` and call `bloc.markContentDirty()` on every keystroke (free `int++`). Dispatch `PreviewContentRefreshRequested` (not `PreviewContentChanged`) when you want a lazy refresh; the bloc short-circuits when the dirty version hasn't moved since the last consume. Only use `PreviewContentChanged` for eager pushes (toggle, checkbox, locale change, content load).
- **Live refresh**: `_scheduleLivePreviewRefresh()` (called from `_onTextChanged`) debounces `PreviewContentRefreshRequested` at 500 ms for non-large notes (`lineCount <= AppConstants.previewPreloadLineThreshold = 3000`). It is gated on `!_isLoading` and `state.hasTheme` so the first build is never blocked. The debounce timer is cancelled in `dispose()`.
- **Search content sync**: `_pushPreviewContent` calls `_searchController.updateContent(content)` when `_searchController.isSearching`; `_scheduleLivePreviewRefresh` does the same after dispatch. Never call `updateContent` inside `build()`. `ReEditorSearchController.updateContent` deduplicates on `identical/==` so redundant calls are free.
- Theme dispatch (`PreviewThemeChanged`) happens from `MarkdownPreviewBlocView` lifecycle hooks (`didChangeDependencies` + a `DevOptions` listener) — never from `build()`. Equality is keyed on `(brightness, debugEnabled)` so closure-only changes do not trigger rebuilds.
- Scroll progress bypasses the bloc event queue: the view calls `bloc.scrollController.updateProgress(progress)` directly to avoid per-frame state churn.
- **Preview view key**: the page holds `final GlobalKey<SourceMappedMarkdownViewState> _previewViewKey = GlobalKey<...>()` as a field. It is bound to the scroll controller in `initState` via `_previewController = _previewBloc.scrollController..bindView(_previewViewKey)` and passed explicitly to `MarkdownPreviewBlocView(viewKey: _previewViewKey)`. Access state via `_previewViewKey.currentState` (e.g. `currentLineIndex`) for preview→editor scroll mapping.
- **Preview→editor scroll**: on toggle back to editor, compare `_previewViewKey.currentState?.currentLineIndex` against `renderService.chunkStartLineForLine(savedBaseIndex)` to detect real user scrolling. Chunks are block-aligned (variable line counts), so never assume `lineIndex ~/ linesPerChunk` — always resolve a chunk's start line through the builder/service. Only snap the editor and move the caret when the user actually moved the preview; otherwise fall back to `_restoreEditorPosition()` which honors the exact saved selection.
- **Toolbar helper**: use `_buildMarkdownBar({required bool enabled})` for both the loading-skeleton and loaded paths. Pass `enabled: false` when loading to preserve layout without wiring live callbacks.
- **Double-tap from preview**: `_handleDoubleTapLine` parks the cursor at end-of-line. `DoubleTapLineDetector` currently always passes `columnOffset = 0` (column resolution from styled spans needs `TextPainter` introspection — future work). Forward-compatible: when a future detector passes `columnOffset > 0`, the handler clamps it to the line length.
- Adaptive chunk sizing lives in `MarkdownChunker.adaptiveChunkSize` (capped at `maxAdaptiveChunkSize = 100`) so `scrollToLineIndex` precision stays usable on huge notes. The render service applies it before constructing the builder; the builder then receives the final per-chunk target.
- The empty-preview placeholder text is locale-cached on the page (`_emptyPreviewPlaceholder`) and re-dispatched when the locale changes while the note is empty.
- Preview hyperlinks: the page passes `_handleLinkTap` to `MarkdownPreviewBlocView.onTapLink`. The handler validates the scheme against `_allowedLinkSchemes` (`http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`), launches via `url_launcher` in `LaunchMode.externalApplication`, and shows a localized `CustomSnackbar.showError` (`linkSchemeNotAllowed` / `linkOpenFailed`) on rejection or failure. Do not bypass scheme validation.

## Markdown Block Model And Chunking
`lib/utils/markdown_chunker.dart` is the single source of truth for how note content is divided into render chunks. Both the preview renderer **and** the editor's debug chunk overlay consume it, so their chunk boundaries are guaranteed identical.

- `MarkdownChunker.computeLayout({lineCount, chunkSize, lineAt})` returns a `MarkdownChunkLayout` = `{ blocks: List<MarkdownBlock>, chunkStartLines: List<int> }`. It runs one O(n) forward scan.
- `MarkdownBlock { kind, startLine, endLine, atomic }` models **multi-line** blocks only (today: `MarkdownBlockKind.codeFence`, including an unterminated fence that runs to EOF). Single-line content (paragraphs, headings, list items, blockquotes, rules, single table rows) is **implicit** — never modeled — so the block list stays O(number of multi-line blocks), not O(lines).
- Chunk boundaries are **block-aligned**: `atomic` blocks are never split across a chunk; non-atomic blocks (code fences) may be split so very large code blocks keep virtualizing. When you add a single-widget block type (table, math), set `atomic: true` and chunking keeps it whole automatically — the preview and the editor overlay both inherit the alignment.
- The builder exposes block-aware helpers used everywhere instead of `lineIndex ~/ linesPerChunk`: `chunkStartLine(i)`, `chunkLineCount(i)`, `chunkIndexForLine(line)` (binary search), and `_blockForLine(line)` for code-fence membership (replaced the old per-chunk code-block state caches). `MarkdownRenderService.chunkStartLineForLine(line)` is the service-level convenience for the page.
- The recursive inline parser (`_parseInline`) is offset-preserving: every leaf text run is routed through `_applyHighlighting` with its exact source offset, so search highlights stay aligned through nested emphasis, links, escaping, and ghost/list content. When adding inline syntax, keep this contract — never break the source-offset threading.

## Markdown Lists
`lib/utils/markdown_list_syntax.dart` (`MarkdownListSyntax`) is the **single source of truth** for list grammar, shared by the editor and the renderer so they can never disagree about what is a list.

- `MarkdownListSyntax.parse(line) -> MarkdownListItem?` classifies a line as `MarkdownListKind.{bullet, ordered, task}` and returns the indent string, marker, ordered delimiter (`.` or `)`), checked state, the `[` bracket column (tasks), the content-start column, and the content text. All columns are line-relative; the renderer adds the line's source-start offset for absolute positions. Detection order is task → bullet → ordered.
- Supported (GFM): `-`, `*`, `+`, `•` bullets; `N.` / `N)` ordered; `- [ ]` / `- [x]` tasks (markers `-`, `*`, `+`). `indentLevel` counts columns (tab = 2) and divides by `indentUnit = 2`.
- The editor (`MarkdownListUtils`) delegates all detection to `MarkdownListSyntax`: `getListPrefix` (Enter-continuation — preserves indentation, continues tasks unchecked, increments ordered numbers keeping the delimiter), `isEmptyListItem` (terminate list on Enter), `isListLine` (Tab/Shift-Tab gating).
- The renderer's `buildLine` calls `MarkdownListSyntax.parse(line)` once and dispatches to `_buildCheckboxLine` / `_buildListItem` / `_buildOrderedListItem`. Nesting is a width-based `Padding` (`level * baseFontSize`), never literal spaces; bullets cycle `• ◦ ▪` by depth. Do **not** reintroduce a second list regex anywhere — extend `MarkdownListSyntax`.
- Editor companion: `ModernEditorWrapper` overrides re_editor's `CodeShortcutIndentIntent` / `CodeShortcutOutdentIntent` via `CodeEditor.shortcutOverrideActions` so **Tab / Shift-Tab** indent/outdent a whole list item by `indentUnit` spaces when the caret is on one; non-list lines fall through to re_editor's default `applyIndent()` / `applyOutdent()`.

## Money Ledger (counter processing engine)
A line-led markdown syntax for tracking a running sum (money or any quantity) inside a note. **Opt-in: gated by `SettingsKeys.moneyLedgerEnabled` (default off)** — the flag rides `getMoneyConfig()`, gates both render dispatch paths (preview builder + editor span builder), the wrapper tap zone, and the calendar ledger service (which clears its cache when disabled). Grammar, fixed-point arithmetic, and formatting live in `lib/utils/markdown_money_syntax.dart` (`MarkdownMoneySyntax`), the single source of truth consumed by the preview renderer, the editor span builder, the editor line index, and the preview's ledger pass.

- Syntax (line-led, optional leading whitespace): `$= 100` set/checkpoint, `$+ 12.50 label` add, `$- 8 label` subtract, `$* 1.19` multiply, `$/ 2` divide, `$$ label` running total, `$? label` net change since the last `$=` (or note start), `$! 500 label` spending target (inert; its displayed value is the remaining budget = target − spent since the anchor), `$^ label` / `$^ N label` entry diff (inert; the net change over the last N **balance-changing entries** — an entry is any `$=`/`$+`/`$-`/`$*`/`$/`; display rows `$$`/`$?`/`$!`/`$^` never count — with N a 1–3 digit count ending at a space/EOL so `2024`/`3x` stay label text, defaulting to 1). All stored entry values flow through `MarkdownMoneySyntax.displayValue(m, balance, history, periodStart)` — the single source of truth across all folds, where `history` is the append-only entry-balance list (index 0 = note start, one value appended per entry via `isEntryKind`) and `periodStart` is the history index of the current period's `$=`. **A `$=` resets the diff window**: `$^ N` clamps its reference to `periodStart`, so it never reaches across a checkpoint and once N spans the whole period `$^` equals `$?`. `$=` doubles as a period boundary — put one under a month/year heading and close the period with `$?`. Target rows render the remaining as a sign-colored pill in the preview (green under, red over — but an accent token overrides that like it does on every other row) and stay source-faithful (`!` → `◎`, text-keyed cache) in the editor unless a value slot gives them somewhere to paint.
- **Composable prefixes** (both matched by shape only in `parse`, so the ledger never depends on any setting): a `#{1,6} ` heading prefix (`## $$ Net worth`, `MoneyLineMatch.headerStart/headerLevel`) renders the row at that heading's scale — preview scales `baseStyle` by the hX scale, editor conceals the hashes and scales the root span's fontSize (same line-height mechanism as `_buildHeader`); and a letter-led `name:` accent token after the op (`$+ blue: 250 rent`, `MoneyLineMatch.accentStart/accentEnd`, `:` must be followed by space/EOL so `$$ http://…` labels stay intact, letter-led so `$+ 250: x` can never read as an accent) overrides the row's semantic accent with a palette colour — resolved at render time against `MarkdownColorPalette`; a resolved token is concealed chrome, an **unresolved token renders literally with the semantic accent and the line still counts** (editing the palette can never change a balance). **The whole row takes the row accent — chrome glyph, value, *and* label** (`labelStyle` on both surfaces: colour only, base weight kept so the value still leads). That means the *semantic* sign colour too: a plain `$+ 12.50 rent` renders "rent" green, `$- 8 food` renders "food" red. An unresolved accent token is literal label text and takes the label colour with it. (v1 kept semantic colours off the label — Alex overruled it: a row coloured only on its number reads half-styled.) **A resolved token wins on every row kind, no carve-outs** — `$$`'s negative-red, `$?`'s direction colour, and `$!`'s green/under-red/over status colour all yield to it. (`$!` used to be the exception; it made `$! red:` ambiguous — token or over-budget warning? — and over-budget stays readable regardless since the remaining value renders with a leading `-`.) The one thing a token does *not* recolour is op rows' dimmed trailing `= balance`: that grey marks "computed, not typed", and the distinction outranks row colour. Cheap probes (`leadsWithMoney` / `leadsWithMoneyInRange`) accept the heading prefix; a `#…$`-led line that fails the money parse falls through to normal heading rendering on both surfaces.
- **Label-first op rows** (`$= $+ $- $* $/` only): the typed amount may trail behind a `:` — `$= Net worth: 5000`, `## $- blue: Loss/Gain/Whatever: 5000`, `$* VAT: 1.19` — parsed by `_scanTrailingAmount` as a fallback when no digits sit at the amount position. **The colon is required and load-bearing**: without it `$- food 2024` would silently subtract 2024, so a colon-less label still refuses to parse (renders plain, unchanged). The whole tail after the last `:` must be the amount and nothing else (`$= Net worth: 5000 as of today` → plain text, no guessing which number); everything before it is label, colons included. Amount limits/`$/ 0` rejection apply identically — `_parseAmount` is now a shared helper used by both positions. This is the **only** shape where `labelStart < amountStart`, so **both renderers compare them to pick an emission order and must use `labelEnd`, never "label runs to line end"** (`money_detail_sheet` too). Display rows are unaffected: `$$`/`$?`/`$^` take no amount and `$!` reads naturally amount-first.
- **Value slot** (`MoneyLineMatch.valueSlot`, -1 when absent): a lone `$` in the label marks where the row's computed value renders instead of its default position, so label text can precede the number without the marker leaving the line start — `$$ Current sum: $`, `## $$ blue: Net worth: $`, `$+ 12.50 groceries, now $`. Shape-matched like the other prefixes (a `$` delimited by spaces or EOL, so `$5`/`US$`/`$$` in a label stay literal; first one wins) and scanned by `_scanValueSlot` **only from inside `parse`** — never from `leadsWithMoney`, so the prefix probe every document line pays is untouched by the feature. Composes with every op, heading level, and accent colour. It is purely a display concern: `apply`/`displayValue`/`history`/`periodStart` never see it, and a doc's balances are identical with and without slots. `$=` is the one row with no default-position value (its typed amount already *is* the balance it sets), so an explicit slot is how a `$=` row shows a formatted, currency-suffixed value.
- The balance is **derived from note content** — nothing is persisted, no counter is mutated, re-rendering can never double-count, and the data rides note backups automatically (the "derived from content" precedent, like the planned TagIndex).
- All arithmetic is fixed-point int (cents for balances, 1/10000ths for amounts): no float drift. Multiply/divide round half away from zero to the cent; balances clamp to ±`balanceLimitCents`. Amounts accept `.` or `,` decimals; a malformed amount rejects the whole line so it renders as plain text.
- **Preview**: `LineBasedMarkdownBuilder._computeMoneyLedger()` folds the ledger once per `prepare` (O(n) lead-char probe over `_source`; only `$`-led lines outside multi-line blocks parse). `_buildMoneyLine` consumes the `$x` marker as chrome (like `[!TYPE]`), renders sign glyphs `+ − × ÷ = Σ Δ` in the shared `MarkdownConstants.moneyPositive/moneyNegative/moneyNeutral` palette, keeps the amount and label offset-mapped for search, and appends the computed running balance (dimmed on op rows, pill-tinted on `$$`/`$?` rows). Computed values are not source text and carry no offsets. The value span is built once by the local `buildValue({required bool atSlot})` closure so the slot and default positions can never drift apart — `atSlot` only drops the `=` lead-in that reads as an annotation at row end but as noise mid-sentence. With a slot the label renders as **two** independently inline-parsed runs at their true source offsets (before/after the slot), so search still lands on label text either side of the value; inline formatting spanning the slot is the accepted cost.
- **Editor**: op lines are purely textual (conceal `$`, substitute `-*/` 1:1 with `−×÷`, tint amount; text-keyed span cache — heading hashes and resolved accent tokens are also textual conceals, so they ride the same memo). `$$`/`$?`/`$^` lines are positional: the value comes from `MarkdownEditorLineIndex.moneyValueAt` (an incremental money pass mirroring the task pass — the entry-balance history is itself an append-only result list whose per-segment resume state is just its length plus the current period-start index, alongside the entry balance; truncate-and-append, ~one segment rescan per keystroke) and styles through the positional memo with the value folded into the key (`'m:$value:$text'`). The value paints via `_EditorMoneyTotalSpan` (fork `CodeInlinePaintSpan`, substitutes 1:1 for the second marker char, height under the strut; labels `Σ`/`Δ`/`Δ=`). Reveal lines show raw dimmed markers and skip the paint. **A value slot moves any row onto the positional path** (the gate is `valueSlot >= 0 || total/delta/diff`) since its render now depends on the balance — `moneyValueAt` already indexes every money line, so no index change was needed. At the slot the label's `$` is the 1:1 paint placeholder, exactly like the second `$` of a `$$` marker: `_moneyTotalSpan(atSlot: true)` drops the leading glyph and `filled: false` (op rows) drops the chip fill for the dimmed bare-number look matching the preview. Display rows with a slot substitute their second marker char with the glyph instead of the chip — that substitution **must stay one code unit wide or the caret drifts**, which is why `Δ=` narrows to `Δ` there. On reveal the slot stays literal text so the user edits real source.
- Fence lines are inert on both surfaces; lines longer than `MarkdownMoneySyntax.maxLineLength` (= the editor's 4096 raw-render guard) never parse, so the two ledgers can't disagree.
- Toolbar: nine default shortcuts — `default_money` (`$+ `, guard `money_shortcut_seeded`), the subtract/multiply/divide/set/total/change siblings seeded as one batch via `_seedDefaultShortcutBatchIfNeeded` (guard `money_ops_shortcuts_seeded`), then `default_money_target` (`$! `, guard `money_target_shortcut_seeded`) and `default_money_diff` (`$^ `, guard `money_diff_shortcut_seeded`) each on their own later-shipped guard.
- **Display config (start balance + currency)**: global start balance (`SettingsKeys.moneyStartCents`) seeds every ledger fold and the `$?` anchor; currency (global `moneyCurrencySymbol`/`moneyCurrencySuffix`, per-note override under `moneyNoteCurrencyPrefix` keys) applies to computed values only — never source amounts, never parsing. Resolved via `SettingsService.getMoneyConfig(noteId:)` by the editor page on note open / settings return, then: preview via `PreviewMoneyConfigChanged` → state fields → `MarkdownRenderService` rebuild key (**both** prepareWithStyle call sites — the bloc's `_emitPrepared` and `SourceMappedMarkdownView._buildCache` — must pass identical values or the shared cache key flips every build); editor via `MarkdownEditorSpanBuilder.configureMoney` (clears span memos, reseeds `MarkdownEditorLineIndex.setMoneyStart`). Never route money config through `PreviewThemeChanged` (its dedupe gates would swallow it). Backup: the three global keys ride the settings whitelist; per-note overrides export as `noteMoneyCurrencies` (backup version 6, null-tolerant import).
- **Tap-to-detail**: `$$`/`$?`/`$^` values are tappable on both surfaces (preview pill recognizer keyed `'money:$lineIndex'`; editor via `ModernEditorWrapper._resolveTapAction` zone `[markerStart, amountStart)` after the shared pass-through guards — `$^ N` count digits stay editable — enabled through `onMoneyTap` in the interceptor condition). Both route to the page's `_handleMoneyTap` → `MarkdownMoneySyntax.collectEntries` (fence-aware via `lineInFence`, O(document) on tap only; returns `entryLines` + `anchorLines` in order) → `MoneyDetailSheet`. `$?` sheets list entries since the last `$=`; `$^ N` sheets (`_diffWindowEntries`) list the window it measures — the last N balance-changing entries clamped to the current period, from their baseline entry through the tapped row.
- **Calendar surfacing**: `NoteMoneyLedgerService` (derived in-memory singleton, DatabaseLifecycle-registered, invalidated per-note via `NoteRepository.noteChanges`) computes `{balance, net, title}` per event-linked note; `net` sums op effects only (sets are baseline moves). Attribution: a note's net lands on the UTC date of its event's `startDate` only (recurring events never double-count). Surfaces: `MoneyDayBarProvider` / `MoneyDaySummaryProvider` (priority 90, registered in the resolvers' `defaults`) and a `Δ` month total in the calendar header; refreshed in `CalendarBloc` load/create/update handlers.

## Markdown Colors (colored text + colored highlight)
Two colour-aware inline constructs sharing one palette. Grammar, palette decoding, and contrast resolution live in `lib/utils/markdown_color_syntax.dart` (`MarkdownColorSyntax` + `MarkdownColorPalette`), the single source of truth consumed by the preview renderer and the live editor span builder.

- Syntax: `{name:text}` colours the text; `==name:text==` tints a highlight. Plain `==text==` is unchanged and keeps the legacy amber (`MarkdownConstants.markBackgroundLight/Dark`) — the `yellow` preset's highlight *is* that amber, so `==yellow:x==` and `==x==` render identically.
- Names are lowercase `[a-z0-9_-]`, 1..`maxNameLength` (24) chars. The restricted alphabet keeps the scanner branchless and rejects by shape before allocating.
- **An unresolved name is never consumed.** `{note:see below}` stays literal text and `==note: see below==` renders as an ordinary default highlight with its prefix intact, so defining a colour can only add rendering — it can never retroactively eat existing note text.
- Presets: `red orange yellow green teal blue purple pink gray`, each a light/dark pair mirroring the callout/money palettes. Custom colours (settings) shadow presets of the same name.
- **Custom colours are contrast-resolved once, at palette construction**: a picked colour is used verbatim on whichever theme it already reads on and lightness-shifted only far enough to clear a 3.0 contrast ratio against a fixed reference surface on the theme where it would not. Render time is one map probe + a field read — never contrast maths per span. Reference surfaces are fixed (not theme-derived) so a palette can be built in the service layer without a `BuildContext` and stays a valid cache key across both brightnesses.
- Persistence: `SettingsKeys.markdownCustomColors` stores `name=aarrggbb;name=aarrggbb`. `normalizeName` strips everything outside the grammar, so `;` and `=` can never appear in a name and the encoding is injection-safe. `SettingsService.getColorPalette()` memoizes by source; the key rides the backup settings whitelist.
- **`MarkdownColorPalette` is value-equal on its persisted `source` string**, which is what makes it usable directly as a render-cache key (one string compare, `identical` short-circuit) instead of threading a generation counter.
- Threading mirrors the money config exactly: preview via `PreviewColorPaletteChanged` → state → `MarkdownRenderService` rebuild key (**both** `prepareWithStyle` call sites — the bloc's `_emitPrepared` and `SourceMappedMarkdownView._buildCache` — must pass the same palette); editor via `MarkdownEditorSpanBuilder.configureColors` (clears both span memos). Resolved by the page in `_refreshColorPalette` on note open and on settings return, with a `forceRepaint()` nudge only when the palette actually changed — never a remount.
- **Editor rendering is pure conceal**: `{name:` and `}` (and the `name:` prefix inside `==…==`) are transparent + ~0 fontSize, never substituted or removed, so the line keeps every source code unit and caret/selection offsets stay aligned. Reveal (caret) lines show the markers dimmed.
- Composition: colour runs are parsed recursively on both surfaces, so they nest with emphasis, links, tags, lists, headings, callouts, table cells, and money labels in either direction. They are inert inside inline code and code fences, `\{` escapes them, and **ghosts win** — a colour run inside a `{{ … }}` run is never styled (the editor's ghost-skip branch must fall through for non-ghost `{`, or coloured text silently stops rendering on any line containing a ghost).
- Settings: `lib/pages/markdown_colors_page.dart` (presets listed read-only, custom colours add/recolour/rename/delete, live syntax preview), reached from the markdown settings page via `AppNavigator.toMarkdownColors`.
- Toolbar: two default shortcuts — `default_color_text` (`{red:` / `}`) and `default_color_highlight` (`==yellow:` / `==`) — seeded as one batch via `_seedDefaultShortcutBatchIfNeeded` (guard `color_shortcuts_seeded`). Both bypass the generic applier for `_insertWithGhostSlot`: a selection is wrapped like Bold, an empty selection gets an empty ghost in the slot (`{red:{{  }}}`) with **the whole ghost run selected** so the first keystroke replaces it. The ghost must be *selected*, never merely have the caret inside it — typing into the placeholder leaves the run a ghost (`{red:{{ hello }}}`) and the ghost's dim styling overrides the colour, so the text renders grey and the feature looks broken. The wrapper text is read from the shortcut, so editing it to `{green:` — or duplicating it per colour — keeps the behavior. **The colour name itself cannot be a ghost**: `{{{red}}` makes the ghost scanner consume the outer `{` (inner becomes `{red`), and a leading-space form (`{ {{c}}:…}`) would need the name grammar to accept whitespace, which would start matching pasted JSON. Colour names stay literal by design.

## Ghost Text (fill-in placeholders)
Ghost text is an inline, single-line `{{ … }}` placeholder rendered dimmed, used for workout templates ("fill in your weight"). Syntax + scanning live in `lib/utils/ghost_text.dart` (`GhostText`), the single source of truth consumed by the preview renderer, the editor span builder, the editor tap-handling, and the toolbar shortcut.

- `GhostText.findGhosts(line)` / `matchAt` / `ghostAtOffset` return `GhostMatch { start, end, innerStart, innerEnd }` (line-relative). Markers are `{{` / `}}` (distinct from single-brace counter tokens `{c1}` / `{c2}`).
- **Authoring**: it is a normal default shortcut (`default_ghost` in `DefaultMarkdownShortcuts`, wraps selection as `{{ … }}`), so it appears in the markdown settings Shortcuts list — reorderable / hideable / editable like Bold. `MarkdownBarService._seedGhostShortcutIfNeeded()` is a one-time migration (guarded by the `ghost_shortcut_seeded` setting) that appends it to pre-existing profiles. The page special-cases it in `_handleShortcut` (caret lands between the markers on an empty selection).
- **Preview** (`LineBasedMarkdownBuilder._buildGhostSpan`, reached from `_parseInline`): markers hidden, inner text dimmed via `LineMarkdownStyle.ghostColor`, search-highlight offsets preserved on the inner text. Tapping a ghost fires `onGhostTap(absStart, absEnd)` → plumbed service → bloc (`bindCallbacks`) → `MarkdownPreviewBlocView.onGhostTap` → page `_handleGhostTap`, which switches to the editor and **selects** the run (no mutation).
- **Editor**: `_buildGhostEditorSpan` (a re_editor `CodeLineSpanBuilder` on the content controller) dims the run and conceals the `{{` / `}}` markers (transparent + ~0 width — characters stay in the model so caret/selection offsets never desync). Tapping a ghost selects the whole run (`ModernEditorWrapper._maybeActivateTappedGhost`, armed by a pointer-up + caret-landing check so arrow-key navigation never triggers it). Typing replaces the selection; tapping away keeps the placeholder (nothing is mutated, so "restore on leave" is automatic).

## Data And Persistence Rules
- The database uses Drift with a singleton active database and background `LazyDatabase` connection.
- Folder, note, and content chunk tables include CRDT-style metadata for future sync: `hlcTimestamp`, `deviceId`, `version`, `isDeleted`, and optional `deletedAt` where supported.
- Notes store metadata separately from content. Content is chunked and may be compressed; avoid unnecessary full-content copies in hot editor paths.
- Reorder operations should be transactional and preserve user-defined positions.
- Search uses both SQLite/FTS and an app-level index; keep indexes in sync when notes are created, updated, deleted, or moved.
- Counters use `noteId == ''` for global values in `counter_values`; per-note values use the real note id.
- Custom markdown shortcuts can bind up to two counters via `CustomMarkdownShortcut.counters` (`List<CounterBinding>`). Each binding has a `counterId` and a `CounterOp` (`increment` / `decrement`). The `{c1}` / `{c2}` tokens in `beforeText` / `afterText` / repeat wrapper text expand to the matching binding's post-mutation value at insertion time. Each token occurrence triggers exactly one mutation per repeat iteration. Token expansion runs through `ShortcutApplier` via the `CounterMutator` callback, which routes to `CounterBloc` (`IncrementCounter` / `DecrementCounter`) and respects the global vs per-note scope contract. The legacy `counterId` field is preserved for backwards compatibility — when `counters` is empty but `counterId` is set, `effectiveCounters` synthesises a single increment binding so applier logic stays uniform.
- Settings are stored through `UserSettingsDao`, `SettingsService`, and `SettingsKeys`. Do not scatter raw string keys.

## Import/Export Pipeline Rules
- Every layer has paired `createX` / `importX` methods on `FolderDao`/`NoteDao`, the matching repositories, and the storage services. `createX` always stamps `createdAt`/`updatedAt` to "now"; `importX` accepts caller-supplied timestamps so a round-tripped archive preserves originals. Never widen `createX` with optional timestamp params — add an `importX` overload instead.
- All UI access to import/export goes through `ImportExportBloc`. Pages dispatch events (`ExportNoteRequested`, `ExportFolderRequested`, `ExportItemsRequested`, `ImportFileRequested`, `ImportArchiveRequested`) and react to `ImportExportInProgress` / `ImportExportExportSuccess` / `ImportExportImportSuccess` / `ImportExportFailure`.
- Archive format: per-folder `_folder.json` (carries name, `createdAt`, sort orders), per-note JSON/MD/TXT bodies, top-level `manifest.json` with `version` (`ImportExportService.archiveVersion`). When bumping the manifest schema, also bump `archiveVersion` and accept the previous version in `_assertSupportedManifest`. Reject newer versions with `UnsupportedArchiveVersionException` before any DB writes.
- Temp files: every export lands under `getTemporaryDirectory()`. `shareExport` deletes the file after the share sheet returns; `sweepStaleExports` runs at app startup from `main.dart` and clears artefacts older than 24h. New export entry points must funnel through these helpers — do not invoke `SharePlus` directly from blocs/pages.

## Localization And Copy
- Primary source is `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`; keep German and Romanian files complete whenever keys change.
- Prefer concise, direct copy suitable for a utility app. The user may be in the middle of a workout, so labels should be short and easy to recognize.
- Avoid in-app explanatory text for obvious interactions. Use tooltips, icons, labels, and settings descriptions where appropriate.
- Keep domain terms consistent: folders, notes, counters, shortcuts, backup, import/export, auto-save, preview, search.

## UI And UX Direction
- This is a productivity/tracking app, not a marketing site. Favor compact, stable, repeat-use interfaces.
- Use Material 3 and existing constants for spacing, text, colors, icons, and dimensions.
- Keep controls touch-friendly: icon buttons, tooltips, menus, toggles, sliders, reorder handles, and clear destructive confirmations.
- Avoid layout shifts in editor, toolbar, counters, and folder/note lists. Stable dimensions matter more than decorative styling.
- For gym progress features, prefer quick capture patterns: reusable templates, pinned counters, recent/frequent actions, clear save status, and minimal taps.
- Respect light/dark/system themes and supported locales.

## Error Handling And State
- Prefer existing sealed/result-style patterns where available, but match the exact style in the target BLoC or service.
- Keep BLoC states immutable and `Equatable` where that is already the local pattern.
- Complete provided `Completer`s on success and error where events expose them.
- Use `debugPrint` for internal diagnostics where the file already does; user-facing errors must be localized.
- Avoid swallowing persistence failures in code paths where data loss could result. Surface save/import/export errors clearly.

## Validation Commands
Use PowerShell-compatible commands on Windows.

```powershell
dart analyze lib
flutter gen-l10n
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

Release/device helper scripts exist:

```powershell
.\build_release.bat arm64
.\install_to_device.bat arm64
.\generate_drift.bat
```

Run only the commands relevant to the change. For UI-only Dart changes, `dart analyze lib` is usually the minimum validation. For l10n changes, run `flutter gen-l10n`. For Drift changes, run build_runner before analysis.

## Generated And Local Package Notes
- `packages/re_editor/` is a local editor fork, perf-tuned for this app. Key optimizations to preserve:
  - `CodeLines.asString` uses a 2-slot round-robin cache (LF+trimNewlines vs LF-only calls alternate without thrashing).
  - `_CodeLineSegmentQuckLineCount` sub-counts with a `_hashCache` field; `==` short-circuits on length/dirty/lineCount/charCount before deep comparison.
  - `findDisplayParagraphByLineIndex` and `_findDisplayRenderParagraph` in `_code_field.dart` use binary search on the sorted paragraph array.
  - `_CodeParagraphCache` is a bounded LRU (max 512 entries) that evicts head on overflow.
  - `_CodeHighlight` debounces highlight requests at 50 ms to avoid per-keystroke re-highlight.
  - `_kInitialCodeLines` uses `List.unmodifiable` on both levels for write-protection (no `const` because sub-objects aren't `const`).
  - When adding new mutation paths to `CodeLines`, call `cloneShallowDirty()` (not the public constructor) to preserve the `_segmentEnds` / `_asStringCache` reset contract.
  - `CodeInlinePaintSpan` (`code_paragraph.dart`): a placeholder span that reserves a box in the line layout and custom-paints onto the canvas after `drawParagraph` (used by the editor's task checkboxes). It occupies exactly one U+FFFC code unit, so span builders must substitute it 1:1 for a single source character; keep its height under the strut height (placeholders ignore `forceStrutHeight`) or the line grows. `_ParagraphImpl` pairs paint spans with `getBoxesForPlaceholders()` boxes lazily on first draw.
  - `CodeDecoratedTextSpan` + `CodeTextDecoration` (`code_paragraph.dart`): a text run that paints a rounded chip BEHIND itself (before `drawParagraph`) — used for the editor's `#tag` pills and inline-code chips. Unlike `CodeInlinePaintSpan` it reserves no layout space; the text stays ordinary editable text.
  - `trucate` / `_dropPrefix` keep untouched subtrees by identity (no rebuild) — required so decorated/placeholder subclass spans survive the hanging-indent marker/content split; don't regress this to unconditional copies.
  - `_CodeFieldRender.describeSemanticsConfiguration` announces the editor as a multiline text field (value from the `asString` cache) — without it the raw-canvas editor is invisible to screen readers. `codes`/`hasFocus`/`readOnly` setters call `markNeedsSemanticsUpdate()`.
- Treat `packages/re_editor/` as part of the workspace for bug/perf fixes, but avoid API-breaking changes.
- Generated localization Dart files are outputs from ARB files.
- `lib/database/database.g.dart` is generated by Drift.
- Android/iOS/macOS/Linux/Windows/web folders are platform shells; prefer app-level fixes in `lib/` unless the issue is platform-specific.

## Good Defaults For New Gym Progress Features
- If a feature captures workout data, decide whether it belongs in note markdown, a counter, settings, or database schema before adding new storage.
- Prefer note-level features when the data is naturally part of a workout session, and counter features when the value needs repeated numeric updates or cross-note aggregation.
- Preserve backup/export support for any persisted user data.
- Make sorting, pinning, and reordering explicit when users are likely to curate workout information manually.
- Keep input flows fast: sensible defaults, remembered choices, localized validation, and no unnecessary dialogs.
