/// Persisted custom calendar events. The recurrence rule is stored as
/// [ruleKind] plus an optional JSON [rulePayload] for kinds that carry data
/// (currently only `weekly` uses payload `{"weekdays":[1,3,5]}`).
///
/// [endDate] (added in schema v11) is an inclusive upper bound for any
/// recurring rule — the event stops producing occurrences strictly after
/// this UTC date. `null` means "no end".
///
/// [startMinute] / [durationMinutes] (also v11, reserved) are placeholders
/// for future time-of-day events. They are currently never written by
/// application code; they exist so we can introduce timed events without
/// another migration.
///
/// [noteId] (added in schema v14) is an optional link to a workout note
/// (`notes.id`). `null` means the event has no linked note. The folder is
/// resolved from the note at navigation time, so only the id is stored —
/// the link survives the note being moved between folders.
///
/// [colorValue] / [tintIcon] / [priority] (added in schema v16) drive
/// per-event presentation. [colorValue] is an optional 32-bit ARGB override
/// (NULL = use the category color); [tintIcon] decides whether that color
/// also tints the icon; [priority] (1–5, default 3) orders bars / summary
/// entries and decides which bars win a day cell's limited slots.
