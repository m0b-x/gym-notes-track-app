/// Persisted public holidays.

/// Each row is a single dated holiday. The composite primary key
/// `(date, name_key)` allows multiple holidays to coexist on the same
/// day — e.g. a built-in [PublicHoliday.easterMonday] and a user-added
/// custom note for that date — which the previous date-only PK could
/// not represent.
///
/// Columns:
/// - [date]: UTC date-only (year, month, day).
/// - [nameKey]: localizable enum name (e.g. `newYear`, `easterMonday`)
///   for built-in holidays. User-added rows use the sentinel `custom`
///   and store their display string in [customLabel].
/// - [profile]: which `HolidayProfile` owns this row. Built-in rows are
///   tagged with the profile that seeded them (e.g. `generic`,
///   `romania`); custom rows use the sentinel `custom`. This lets the
///   service swap profiles cleanly: rows tagged with the *previous*
///   profile are deleted, rows tagged `custom` survive every switch.
///
/// Movable holidays (Easter and its dependents) are seeded as concrete
/// dated rows per year by `PublicHolidayService` using add-if-not-exists
/// semantics, so the year window naturally extends forward without
/// manual migrations.
